Flow control in programming refers to the order in which statements or instructions are executed in a program.

It allows you to controll the program based on certain conditions or repeat specific actions.

The primary tools:
Decision Making:
    (like if, else, switch) 
    
Repetions:
    loops (such as for, while, do-while)
