JavaScript:

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for front-end web development. 
Here are its key applications in bullet points:

- Web Development: JavaScript is the backbone of modern web development, used to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces on websites.

- Client-Side Scripting: It runs on the client side (user's browser), allowing developers to create responsive and interactive web pages without the need for server-side processing.

- Server-Side Development: Through platforms like Node.js, JavaScript is utilized for server-side scripting, allowing developers to build scalable and high-performance web applications.

- Mobile App Development: With frameworks like React Native and Ionic, JavaScript is used to build cross-platform mobile applications.

- Game Development: JavaScript can be used for browser-based games and is also supported by game development engines like Unity.
